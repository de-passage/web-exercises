-- A type of `Void` have no value.
-- So it is impossible to construct `Void`,
-- unless using undefined, error, unsafeCoerce, infinite recursion, etc
-- And there is a function
-- absurd :: Void -> a
-- That get any value out of `Void`
-- We can do this becuase we can never have void in the zeroth place.

-- so, when are two type, `a` and `b`, considered equal?
-- a definition might be, it is possible to go from `a` to `b`,
-- and from `b` to `a`.
-- Going a roundway trip should leave you the same value.
-- Unfortunately it is virtually impossible to test this in Haskell.
-- This is called Isomorphism.

-- If we have isoUnEither,
-- We have ISO () Void by calling isoUnEither isoEU
-- That is impossible, since we can get a Void by substL on ISO () Void
-- So it is impossible to have isoUnEither
